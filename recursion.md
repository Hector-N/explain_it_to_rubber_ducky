# Recursion

## What is recursion?
## The purpose of recursion?
## Real world examples for applying recursion?

## My answer

Recursion - is a method of solving problem by breaking down the problem  
until it can be solved directly, and then reapplying it on the original problem.  
Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem  
is based on solving smaller instances of the same problem.  
Recursion - is process, which can make calls to itself.  
Recursion is used not only to solve computational problems.  
In general - it's used by human thinking process.  
This also corresponds to human language, that has infinite complexity.  

For solving problem recursively:
1. Find the method to break down the problem.
2. Think of the base case - condition when reduced problem can be solved without further recursion.  
3. Define termination condition when get to base case.
4. Make recursive calls.
5. Prevent recursion to end up in an infinite loop.

## Practical examples are:
* language processing, regular expressions
* recursive search, folder structures
* implementing algorithms: minimax
* implementing structures: binary tree search

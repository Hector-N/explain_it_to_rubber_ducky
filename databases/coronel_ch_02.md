# Review Questions, chapter 2


## 1. Discuss the importance of data models.

Model - is conceptual representation of world objects or business themes.  
Developing data models helps to reveal business needs of storing and manipulating its data.  
Models, as it is visual tool, help in communication between database designer and customer.  


## 2. What is a business rule, and what is its purpose in data modeling?

Business rule - is a 'law' according to which the particular organization or event is behaved in its specific environment needs.  
Establishing models througs revealing business rules - main concept of data modelling.  


## 3. How do you translate business rules into data model components?

Within business rule, we need define entities and their relationship.  
For example: "Employee works for one and only one department. Department has multiple employees." is   
a business rule, from which we can conclude that there are 'employee' and 'department' entities, and  
they participate in particular relationship.  


## 4. Describe the basic features of the relational data model and discuss their importance to the end user and the designer.

Relational Data Model - model based on the mathematical theory of 'relations'.  
With help of relational modelling, we can consolidate and record all the business rules within organization.  
Each entity set within this model are represented as two dimentional table,  
that allows to keep track of each entity's instance state through entity attributes.  


## 5. Explain how the entity relationship (ER) model helped produce a more structured relational database design environment.

Structural design - separating businness concepts and establiching relationships among them.  


## 6. Consider the scenario described by the statement “A customer can make many payments, but each payment is made by only one customer.” Use this scenario as the basis for an entity relationship diagram (ERD) representation.


## 7. Why is an object said to have greater semantic content than an entity?

An object can represent its behaviour and state through methods, while entity has only attributes.  
This peculiarity allows to have more meaning to object.


## 8. What is the difference between an object and a class in the object-oriented data model (OODM)?

Class in data oriented modelling - is objects set, that share the same set of attitbutes and logically connected.  
Object - is particular instance of class.  


## 9. How would you model Question 6 with an OODM? (Use Figure 2.4 as your guide.)



## 10. What is an ERDM, and what role does it play in the modern (production) database environment?



## 11. What is a relationship, and what three types of relationships exist?



## 12. Give an example of each of the three types of relationships.



## 13. What is a table, and what role does it play in the relational model?



## 14. What is a relational diagram? Give an example.



## 15. What is connectivity? (Use a Crow’s Foot ERD to illustrate connectivity.)



## 16. Describe the Big Data phenomenon.



## 17. What does the term 3 Vs refer to?



## 18. What is Hadoop, and what are its basic components?



## 19. What are the basic characteristics of a NoSQL database?



## 20. Using the example of a medical clinic with patients and tests, provide a simple representation of how to model this example using the relational model and how it would be represented using the key-value data modeling technique.



## 21. What is logical independence?



## 22. What is physical independence?

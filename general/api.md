# Application Programming Interface

## Did you hear about API?

## My answer 

Only overheard.  
API are everywhere.   
API provides us access to the functionality and data of tons of services.  
A web page may be considered API, with it, we can interact with backend programming logic.  
In that web page may be embedded another API, providing us with third party API functionality.  

Examples of API:
* weather widgets on sites (sites usually don't provide weather report service, and use weather API)
* third party logging (log in to some_site using google or facebook, etc.)
* payments with pay-pal
* booking systems
* translators
* Python's database APIs
* Django's ORM API
